## Neural Network ##
neural network hehehe

## Intro ##
My Neuralnetwork was made without importing any Neural Network libraries like Numpy or tenorflow. I
made this Neural Net in python.

## Use ##
To identify hand writghting and eventualy respond to the words/phrases on physical sources. Alowing
this Neural net to look at a document and recocnize words make coping notes into a document or to answer
questions on physical paper easier and faster. 

## How ##
This Neural Network will use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for a "Document scaning" ability. A 
CNN based NN will alow the NN to understand the image(s) deeper alowing it to answer your questiona better.
